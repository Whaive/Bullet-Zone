# Bullet Zone Source Code

This repo contains the Source Code for Bullet Zone, a game that took part in the **Brackeys gamejam 2021.2**.
The code can be a bit scuffed since it was made in a hurry in 7 days, so if you find weird "hacky" sections in it, that's why. 
However, If you're new to *Godot* I totally encourage you to clone or download this project to your machine and take a look in the engine itself, since it
shows you the workflow of the engine and the way you can manipulate and use nodes.
